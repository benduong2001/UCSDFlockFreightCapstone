Our resulting offer acceptance method consists of a baseline secretary method that utilizes a trained linear regression model that estimates the number of offers expected and a prior that uses a linear regression model that predicts the estimated cost. The expected number of offers is modeled using the following features: the boolean features of the Orders Dataset, 'APPROXIMATE DRIVING ROUTE MILEAGE', 'PALLETIZED LINEAR FEET', 'SECONDS BETWEEN ORDER AND DEADLINE',
'LOAD BAR COUNT', and 'ESTIMATED COST AT ORDER' while the estimated cost is trained using two features: 'SECONDS BETWEEN ORDER AND DEADLINE' and 'ESTIMATED COST AT ORDER'. The seconds between order and deadline is a new column generated by taking the difference between the 'PICKUP DEADLINE PST' and the 'ORDER DATETIME PST' column. Our prior works by comparing the estimated cost and
the rate given for the first $n/e$ offers and if any of those offers have a rate less than the estimated cost to ship then we automatically accept that offer instead of moving on with the secretary method. We evaluated our offer acceptance method by comparing the average rate of the offers we chose in the test dataset, to the average rate of the historically accepted offers and found that the historically accepted rates were around 150 cheaper. The distribution of our accepted offers and the historically accepted offers can be seen below.
